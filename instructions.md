Snowflake Applied AI: Candidate homework assignment
 
Overview
Your task is to build an interactive, chat based agent which can answer questions related to the US population. The agent must be able to understand and answer questions using natural language.
 
Requirements
Use a free Snowflake trial account to develop your solution.
Leverage the US Open Census data set, available for free on the Snowflake Marketplace:
https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/listing/GZSNZ2UNN0/safegraph-us-open-census-data-neighborhood-insights-free-dataset


Create an agent that can answer natural language questions based on this data set.
Provide a web based interface for users to interact with the agent.
Apply guardrails to ensure the agent does not answer off topic questions or provide “not safe for work” responses.
Ensure the agent can, at a minimum, answer these questions:
In which areas of the country do residents spend, on average, over 30% of their income on rent?
Which states have the longest average commutes?
Which cities have the highest amount of migration (people moving in)?
What are the top states with non-English speaking populations?
 
Deliverables
Within 48 hours, you must send us an email with a link to a private github repository shared with sfc-gh-setli and sfc-gh-nwiegand.
 
The repo must include:
All the code you wrote to implement your solution.
Instructions for accessing the web application you developed (it must be running somewhere on the internet and not require setting it up locally).
A short markdown document that describes your development process and a list of things you would improve if you had more time.
 
FAQs
Q: Do I need to build and run my solution exclusively on the Snowflake platform?
A: No. The data is being made available through Snowflake Marketplace, but you are free to develop your application however you wish.
 
Q: Is it ok if viewing the demo requires authentication?
A: Yes, provided you include instructions (with credentials) in your write-up so that we can access the demo.
